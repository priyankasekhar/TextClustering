#ABSTRACT

In computer forensic analysis, hundreds of thousands of files are usually examined. In the current scenario , human categorization is made use of to categorize these documents. The inherent problem in this approach is that it is very time-consuming and costly, thus limiting its applicability especially for large or rapidly changing collections. In the past few years, several learning techniques such as rule-based approaches similar to those used in expert systems have been used, but they generally require manual construction of the rules, make rigid binary decisions about category membership, and are typically difficult to modify.  

I present an approach that applies document categorization algorithms to e-mail messages for the purpose of filtering them to aid in police investigations. I propose a novel active learning algorithm which is performed in the data manifold adaptive kernel space. By minimizing the expected error with respect to the optimal classifier, I can select the most representative and discriminative data points for labeling. After categorizing the unknown documents into groups, we will perform topic identification, which would identify the common theme among the groups accordingly.  This will aid the police to manually examine only those documents that need to be dealt with immediately thus saving time as well as allowing investigation to be carried out as per the urgency of the case in question.
